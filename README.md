This project is just a batch file (.bat) available for Windows only, allowing to convert .mkv file to .mp4 file by keeping only 1 audio and 1 video stream among the several streams we can find in .mkv file. 

It allows to choose 1 audio and 1 subtitle stream from the mkv file(s), to merge them into one video mp4 file. (Note that the subtitles are burnt on the video itself)

It can perform the algorithm on all the files of a folder if all the .mkv files have the same streams structure.

You first need to have installed FFmpeg !!! (accessible via the windows cmd)
-> [How to install FFmpeg on windows](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ffmpeg#How_to_Install_FFmpeg_on_Windows)

An tiny example is provided into the example folder.

You can also download the .exe file [here](https://github.com/benoitdekeyn/mkv-to-mp4/raw/b5eb5e43aede9e3e414435e69593e81adfd8ddb7/mkv2mp4.exe)
