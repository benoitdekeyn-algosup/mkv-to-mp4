This project is just a batch file (.bat) available for Windows only.
It is a .mkv to .mp4 converter. 
It allows to choose 1 audio and 1 subtitle stream from the mkv, to merge them into one video mp4 file.
It can perform the algorithm on all the files of a folder which have the same streams structure.


For now, It's being created, and nothing is functionnal.

An example is provided into the example folder, but as Github doesn't allow files bigger than 100Mo, the video files I used for my test are not in the right folders. So waiting for reducing their size, You have to have you own .mkv file to test at least.

You'll be able to directly download a release here after
