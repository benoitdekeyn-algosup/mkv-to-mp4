To run the example, you can simply execute the mkv_to_mp4.bat file which is in the src folder.

When it ask to input a file or folder, type the relative path of the videos : ```example```

These 3 videos are extracts of the same video. They are 30 seconds and contain the same streams.

Then, select streams `3` then `1`  (for japanese audio and french subtitles) and you'll have the mp4 file created.
